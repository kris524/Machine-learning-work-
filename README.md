# Machine-learning-work-
Hello, here I will share work completed from introduction to machine learning with python book. This really helped me practise and grasps important concepts. 
My first assignment was to build the KNN algorithm from scratch. I have done this for the iris data and the ionsphere data (given by the lecturer). My grade was 85%.
