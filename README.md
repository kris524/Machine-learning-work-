# Machine-learning-work-
Hello, here I will share work completed from introduction to machine learning with python book. This helped me practise and grasps important concepts. 
My first assignment was to build the KNN algorithm from scratch. I have done this for the iris data and the ionsphere data (given by the lecturer). My grade was 85%. Note that the file Nearest Neighbours 1 is more visually well prepared since I have commented on the print statements to prevent the long list of answers. If you wish to look at the results, uncomment on the print statements.
